# Spot the Mask Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the "Spot the Mask" challenge on [Zindi Africa](https://zindi.africa/competitions/spot-the-mask) This competition aims to push the boundaries of computer vision by addressing the crucial task of identifying individuals wearing masks in images. The ability to automatically detect mask-wearing is of paramount importance in the context of public health, especially during times of pandemics.

## Challenge Description

The task involves developing a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying whether a person in an image is wearing a mask or not. Participants will have access to a labeled dataset consisting of images with corresponding binary labels (1 for mask-wearing, 0 for no mask).

### Evaluation Metric

The competition will be evaluated based on the F1 score. The F1 score is a balanced metric that considers both precision and recall, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

## Data

The dataset provided for this challenge includes a diverse set of images containing people with and without masks. Participants are encouraged to explore and preprocess the data to enhance model performance.

### Data Files

- **image.zip**: This archive contains the set images and corresponding labels.
- **train_lables**: The labels for the image zip.
- **SampleSubmission**: Use this for taking the image for submission.
